# Hello there! Welcome to Portfolio Website Update 👋

This project is a result of dedicated effort, built using some of my favorite technologies: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Framer Motion.

## The Tech Stack 🛠

- **Next.js 14**: I chose Next.js because it's a fantastic framework for building React applications. It handles server-side rendering and static site generation like a champ, and it's got some great developer-friendly features.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is my go-to for styling. It's a utility-first CSS framework that lets me build custom designs directly in my HTML. It's like having a CSS cheat sheet right in my markup!

- **Shadcn UI**: Shadcn UI is a sleek, modern UI library for React. It's got a set of high-quality components that are a breeze to customize and use.

- **Framer Motion**: For animations, I use Framer Motion. It's a production-ready motion library for React that makes animating elements and components a piece of cake.

-**Docker**: I have used Docker to containerize the application.

-**NGNX**: I have used NGNX as a reverse proxy server for the application.

-**AWS**: I have used AWS to deploy the application.
