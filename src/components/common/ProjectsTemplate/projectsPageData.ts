      'This portfolio is a testament to my expertise in modern web development. It features a robust tech stack that includes Docker for containerization, Next.js for efficient server-side rendering, Tailwind CSS for adaptive and responsive designs, and TypeScript for enhanced type safety. Hosted on AWS for scalability, it also showcases dynamic animations powered by Framer Motion. The development pipeline is streamlined with Git workflows for version control, Terraform for infrastructure as code, and Ansible for automated configuration management, ensuring a smooth and efficient deployment process.',
